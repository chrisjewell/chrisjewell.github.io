#### A Preamble
I have a lot of interests, especially technical/nerdy ones, and though they all 
seem to make sense together in my mind, I do find that it can be tricky to remember
what I've been researching, what I've been working on, etc.

I've been inspired by a recent repost of an old Hackaday article to set this site
up to just get these thoughts out and published so that they can serve as "breadcrumbs"
for me or others in the future. (Link to article)

I also realize that I spend a decent amount of time reading articles and watching videos
about making, hacking, reverse engineering, radio, etc. and get inspired to "do something" 
with the knowledge coming from those resources, but, given my propensity for moving from
thing to thing, it's almost certain that many of those ideas will just escape into the
recesses of my mind.

#### My Intentions

So with all of this said, I'm getting this started with the intent of it truly being little
more than a log. I'm not certain this will be something I stick with for any length of
time (the ease of getting things posted and maintaining the site will be a bug factor here),
but I would like to give it a go so that I can at least have something to show for the
these nerdy/fun things going through my mind.

Also note, dear reader, that I am going to attempt to avoid writing for your enjoyment.
I suspect that if I start spending even a little amount of time thinking about what an 
"audience" would be interested in, I won't write anything. That being said, you may not
find what I write here to be interesting or engaging, and that will be okay since my main
goal here is a record of my technical hobbies and interests, and not a successful blog. If
you are interested/engaged with what I am writing here, then by all means stick around,
and perhaps even reach out.

So without dallying longer, let's get this started.
