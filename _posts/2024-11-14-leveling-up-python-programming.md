# The Idea
It occurred to me last night that while I know Python reasonably well for a non-engineer, I have never needed to learn how to write Python code in a very clean and consistent manner, following current PEP[^1] guidelines or best practices. As I make my way deeper into technical topics, and especially as I consider learning new languages, etc., I believe I should start learning how to write Python like a proper software engineer. In short, I would like to take my Python skill level from beginner/intermediate (hacking things together with moderate effort to make code clean and reusable) to a proficiency level that would allow me to serve as a entry/mid-level Python engineer.

# My Approach/Goals
My learning goals may evolve over time as I get into each of them, but as of right now, they look like the following:
- Learn how to read and follow Python style guides
- Learn how to use linting tools, such as `pylint` to clean up and highlight areas that need reformatting
- Learn about various test types and how to write and run them. Known examples include:
	- Unit tests
	- Integration tests
	- Regression tests
- Learn about and really understand development environment setup, including containerization, etc.
- Learn about and practice writing effective code comments and documentation

# Making It Stick
Another more general goal that I have for myself in this season of my life and career is to strengthen my ability to write, make notes[^2], and document processes/code/etc. With that in mind, I will aim to keep writing these things down and tracking my progress, the questions I come across, the answers I find, and the projects I end up making/building using the knowledge I've gained.

I expect that this documentation exercise, alongside committed study/practice will result in deeper learning and higher knowledge retention for myself, but may also allow others to learn alongside me (or learn from my mistakes along the way).

[^1]: Python Enhancement Proposals, or the Python community's system for adopting changes. See more [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
[^2]: Here, _making_ notes as opposed to _taking_ notes is a reference to _[The Art of Note-Making](https://mischavandenburg.substack.com/p/the-art-of-note-making)_ by Mischa van den Burg. The core idea is that by curating and tending to notes like a garden, rather than simply copy-pasting, highlighting, or rushing through, the note _maker_ gains a deeper understanding of the material, and truly learns.
